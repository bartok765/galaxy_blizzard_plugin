# Galaxy plugin for Battle.net

This plugin allows you to install and launch your Blizzard games via the GOG Galaxy 2.0 launcher.

## Installation
Use build-in `Search` engine from GOG Galaxy 2.0 Settings

*Note: The actual code in build-in Search is a reviewed fork https://github.com/FriendsOfGalaxy/galaxy-integration-blizzard prepared by FriendsOfGalaxy*

### From source (tested on windows 10 and macos 10.14 with python 3.7)
- copy / clone this repo
- run:
```bash
cd galaxy_blizzard_plugin
pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
inv install
```

## Note on playtime

Currently we only support displaying the total playtime of your quickplay matches in Overwatch. Playtime might take some time to update after you quit the game.

**Important:** Make sure your Overwatch profile is set to public in order to show your playtime.
To do that, start up Overwatch and navigate to the Options. From there click the "Social" tab and toggle the option "Career Profile Visibility" to "Public".


## Uninstallation (remove all data)
Click `Disconnect` button in GOG Galaxy Settings. If you see `Connect` instead of `Disconnect` (this may happen on plugin crash or accessing from different machine) you need to connect it again and then disconnect.

### "Soft" disconnect (advanced)
If you want to keep imported data (owned games, play time), but do not need to sync more and play with local games, you can "turn off" local plugin:
- close Galaxy
- remove plugin local database (on Windows usually at `C:\ProgramData\GOG.com\Galaxy\storage\plugins`).

## Help us finding Classic Blizzard Games

If you have classic Blizzard games which are not properly detected as installed or don't launch when clicking 'play'
please provide the name and values of the games key under

```
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\
```

Windows registry path (by opening `Run`-> `regedit`)

If on MAC please provide the games bundle_id which can be found by calling

```
/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -dump | grep {game_name}
```
